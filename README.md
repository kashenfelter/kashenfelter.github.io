Coursera Developing Data Products Final Project


This app reads in, processes, and prepares data from the Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE) Freedom of Information (FOIA) data library. The dataset visualized for this project was the list of addresses for all of the ICE Detention Centers located in the United States as of 2015. Since these Centers have been the focus of much press and debate lately, this app helps to contextualize issues such as long-distance parent-child geographical separation when each is sent to different detention center.
